#### Open Mic is a live music social media application designed to allow users to add, rate and follow live music and comedy performance venues. Users who join Open Mic can make personal profile pages, add and rate different venues worldwide, and follow and connect with other live music fans.

##### Open Mic strives to provide users with the most accurate and up-to-date venue information, including ratings from users, comments and contact information. Performers are also able to connect with venues and can use the information to plan a tour.

##### Open Mic uses RESTful routes and CRUD capabilities to allow users to view information on venues and other users, create profiles and reviews, edit and delete profile and venue information.

## Challenges
#### Our group encountered some challenges along the way, most notably with merging our different Git branches together. We had a number of merge conflicts at first but soon decided on a consistent workflow which helped keep merge conflicts to a minimum. We also decided to deploy to Heroku early in the week in order to maintain a consistent database. There were some complex authorization and association problems that arose but we worked as a team to solve the issues that arose. We learned a lot along the way through trial and error and reaching out to others for help.

## Shoutouts
#### First and foremost, big thanks go to our consultant and "Jefe" Ben for giving us our project concept and guiding us throughout the week, and helping us with challenges that arose. Many thanks go to the other consultants and TAs who helped us with questions and issues along the way. And lastly, we'd like to thank all the members of our cohort for helping and encouraging us along the way.
